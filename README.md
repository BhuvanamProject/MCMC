# Introduction to Monte Carlo methods using Python
### (With real world examples in Astronomy and Cosmology)

---

In this workshop we will discuss Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) at the introductory level. This repository has few examples which compliment the lectures. MCMC is a popular method which is employed in various branches of physics. For example in Astrophysics the radiative transfer codes are usually MCMC simulations. We use MCMC in particle physics for estimating background process. THe cosmological model parameters can be estimated by performing MCMC analysis on the dataset. It can also be used to have numerical approximations of multi-dimenssional integrals.

We start with basics of Statistics, with emphasis on Baysian Statistics. Parallely we go through fundamentals of Cosmology on the fisrt day of workshop. On the second day we bring these two things together using some examples.

#### The examples include:
 - estimating value of Pi (without using MCMC)
 - estimating value of PI (using MCMC)
 - Hubble's constant estimation
 - estimating cosmological parameters
