# Introduction to Monte Carlo methods using Python
### (With real world examples in Astronomy and Cosmology)

---

In this workshop we will discuss Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) at the introductory level. This repository has few examples which compliment the lectures. MCMC is a popular method which is employed in various branches of physics. For example in Astrophysics the radiative transfer simulations are usually MCMC codes. We use MCMC in particle physics for estimating background processes. THe cosmological model parameters can be estimated by performing MCMC analysis on the datasets. It can also be used to do numerical integration of multi-dimenssional integrals.

We start with basics of Statistics, with emphasis on Bayesian Statistics. Parallely we go through fundamentals of Cosmology on the fisrt day of workshop. On the second day we bring these two things together using some examples which are available in this repository.

#### The examples include:
 - estimating value of Pi (without using MCMC)
 - estimating value of PI (using MCMC)
 - Hubble's constant estimation
 - estimating cosmological parameters
